If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, set status to `blocked` again.\nOnce the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; set status to `blocked`.\nDo not use `blocked` merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\nDo not mark a goal complete merely because its budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\nYou cannot use this tool to pause, resume, budget-limit, or usage-limit a goal; those status changes are controlled by the user or system.\nWhen marking a budgeted goal achieved with status `complete`, report the final token usage from the tool result to the user."
